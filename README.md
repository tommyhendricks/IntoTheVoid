This is my Programming for Games final project Into The Void. 

In this game you can choose from three diffrent ships that all have their own stats. 
There are several different kinds of enemys to fight while you make your way through
the levels. Each one doing different amounts of damage or having more health. Fight your 
way through three different levels to make it to the end. 


I programmed this game using LOVE2D. This took me around 50 Total hours to make the graphics as 
well as program the whole thing.
