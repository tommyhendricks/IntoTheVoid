This is my Programming for Games final project Into The Void. 

In this game you have multiple ships to chose from to fight 
your way through multiple levels and waves of enemies to make it to the end. 

I programmed this game using LOVE2D. This took me around 50 Total hours to make the graphics as 
well as program the whole thing.
